# TriviaGame

What the project does?:

This project lets users submit a trivia game that is timed, learning about explorers. 

Here's how the app works?:

You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).
The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 
The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.
Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.
Don't forget to include a countdown timer.

Why the project is useful?:

Teaches me jquery, javascript, css skills, and how to create a timer. And bootstrap.

How users can get started with the project?:

To start the trivia game click the start trivia game button. Once you do the time of 1:30 min will start ticking down, and will auto submit when time runs out. Then see how many you got right and wrong!

Who maintains and contributes to the project?:

Just me, Andrew Bagwell.
